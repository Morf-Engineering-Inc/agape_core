Truth Rivers System - "All Rivers Flow to the Ocean"
A collector and sifter of truth where different knowledge domains (rivers) 
flow into an ocean of applied wisdom and understanding.

The premise: To be like God is to understand and know all truth.
Like a calculus limit approaching infinity, we continually approach perfect truth.
