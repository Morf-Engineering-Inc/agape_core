# Truth Discerner

**A biblical truth analysis framework for movies, media, books, and cultural content**

*"Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap." - Galatians 6:7*

## Overview

Truth Discerner is an AI-powered media analysis tool that evaluates entertainment content, social media trends, books, and cultural narratives against biblical truth standards. Built on the Agape Core AI foundation, it helps believers discern between content that portrays truth vs. agenda-driven narratives designed to shift societal values.

## The Problem: Cultural Deception

### Modern Media Challenges
- **Social media addiction** creating dopamine-driven behavioral patterns
- **Narrative manipulation** in movies and entertainment
- **Subtle worldview shifts** through repeated messaging
- **Truth dilution** where "your truth" replaces absolute truth
- **Moral relativism** promoted as tolerance and progress

### Joseph Smith's Warning Applied
*"The most dangerous thing is a little truth mixed with error"* - When media contains partial truths wrapped in deceptive frameworks, it becomes harder to discern the lies.

## Core Mission

**Analyze media content to identify:**
1. **Truth Alignment** - Does this content align with biblical principles?
2. **Worldview Messages** - What underlying beliefs does this promote?
3. **Social Engineering** - Is this designed to change how society thinks?
4. **Spiritual Impact** - How does this affect the viewer's relationship with God?
5. **Cultural Influence** - What behaviors/values is this normalizing?

## Analysis Framework

### Truth Categories
- ‚úÖ **Pure Truth** - Aligns with biblical principles and promotes godly values
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Mixed Truth** - Contains good elements but also concerning messages
- ‚ùå **Deceptive Content** - Promotes worldviews contrary to biblical truth
- üö® **Actively Harmful** - Designed to undermine faith and moral foundations

### Evaluation Criteria

#### 1. Gospel Truth Alignment
- Does this honor God's character?
- Are biblical principles upheld or undermined?
- How are family, marriage, and relationships portrayed?
- What view of human nature is presented?

#### 2. Moral Framework Analysis
- What behaviors are celebrated vs. condemned?
- How are consequences of choices presented?
- Is there moral clarity or relativistic confusion?
- Are virtues like sacrifice, integrity, and service promoted?

#### 3. Worldview Detection
- **Secular Humanism** - Human reason as ultimate authority
- **Materialism** - Physical world is all that exists
- **Relativism** - No absolute truth or moral standards
- **Hedonism** - Pleasure-seeking as life's purpose
- **Progressive Ideology** - Traditional values as oppressive

#### 4. Social Engineering Indicators
- Normalizing previously taboo behaviors
- Redefining fundamental concepts (family, gender, truth)
- Promoting victim/oppressor narratives
- Encouraging rebellion against authority
- Subtle mockery of faith and traditional values
