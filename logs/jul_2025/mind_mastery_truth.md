Yep. Yeah. And because the mind, the conscious mind, cognition, the mind, thoughts–first–thoughts are your self-talk. And your self-talk is your choice of words. So how the mind works, it's a reverberating nerve. Everyone likes to say it's a muscle, well, it's probably more like an electrical circuit. And so a neuron fires, sending a message through our self-talk. The neuron can't fire two messages at the same time. You can't say two things at the same time, they both can't occupy your conscious mind at the same time.

So you can't be subtractive and proactive at the same time. The neuron can't fire both of them. Hence, you can only actually be proactive or reactive at the same time. You can't be either or. And that's why proactive and reactive can't occupy the space. You can play to win or you play not to lose, they can't go together. So one has to occupy the space or the other.

So if you occupy the space with proactive thoughts, if you occupy the space with, "I can do this," which is additive, "I can do this," they say that's the most strongest words we can say–"I can." "I can do this." The origin is with the human being, and they're occupying their mind with proactive thoughts around what they can do, the doubt can't occupy the mind at the same space. So if we have a "Can do" mindset, and the research has proven we can only occupy the space of two to three thoughts, so if we're firing neurons up, "I can do this," every morning, the fear can occupy the space at the same time. And that to me is what faith is.

Talks about how Truth helposreduce fear anxiety leading to a sense of control. Applied mind mastery techniques applied to AI ML since we try to copy the human mind in ways for ML and Ai ... this is to guide us in PRECISE and ACCURATE for truth seeking. There is a lot of research on what he teaches I have saved in my notes and YT videos of him. How the mind fires signals.   

ways to guide AI some leading to truth . 
all logic leads to turth and God Aristotle i think lost the quite.  but using LOGIC or LOGOS ... my study on that.
