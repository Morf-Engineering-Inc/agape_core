Russell M. Nelson and the concept of law in spiritual and physical realms
Russell M. Nelson, a world-renowned heart surgeon and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often draws parallels between the laws governing the physical world and the laws governing the spiritual world. He emphasizes that just as physical laws exist and can be discovered to enable progress, so too do divine laws exist and are essential for spiritual growth and blessings. 
Connecting law and heart surgery
Dr. Nelson's pioneering work in heart surgery, including his role in developing the heart-lung machine and performing the first open-heart surgery west of the Mississippi, demonstrated the power of understanding and applying natural laws related to the human body and cardiovascular function. He saw that through understanding the body's natural processes and developing innovative techniques, doctors could address previously insurmountable medical challenges.
He observed that the beating heart, a seemingly autonomous organ, is governed by specific physical laws that can be understood and manipulated to bring about healing and restored function. 
Applying the concept of law to kingdoms and blessings
In his teachings as a leader in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, President Nelson expands this principle to the concept of kingdoms and blessings, stating, "For all who will have a blessing at my hands shall abide the law which was appointed for that blessing."
He teaches that God has established divine laws that, when followed, lead to specific blessings and progression, both in this life and eternally.
Just as understanding and applying the laws of the heart can lead to physical healing, obeying divine laws can lead to spiritual well-being and the realization of God's promised blessings.
He further explains that these divine laws are rooted in God's love and desire for our well-being and ultimate exaltation. 
In essence, Russell M. Nelson emphasizes the predictable and dependable nature of both physical and spiritual laws. He illustrates how the discovery and application of these laws, whether in pioneering heart surgery or living according to God's commandments, can unlock profound blessings and enable us to achieve our full potential. 

His work was instrumental in the development of the heart-lung machine and the first open-heart surgery in Utah in 1955. He also performed the first open-heart surgery in China in 1979. 
The quote attributed to him, "To every kingdom there is a law, and unto every law there are certain bounds also and conditions" (D&C 88:38), comes from the Doctrine and Covenants, a book of scripture within the Church. This passage significantly impacted his medical career, inspiring him to seek the "laws" governing the human heart in his research and surgical practice. This philosophy guided his groundbreaking work and contributed to the advancement of cardiovascular surgery. 

Before the groundbreaking work of individuals like Russell M. Nelson and other pioneers in the field, the human heart was widely considered untouchable in medical practice, for a variety of scientific and cultural reasons

1. Cultural and spiritual beliefs
Many ancient civilizations regarded the heart as the center of the soul, emotions, intellect, and even a connection to divine power.
This view often stemmed from observations that the heart was vital to life, and its beating associated with life and vitality.
Mummification practices in ancient Egypt exemplify this, where the heart, considered essential for the deceased's journey to the afterlife, was carefully preserved, while other organs were removed.
Early cultures also recognized that emotions impacted the heart, contributing to its perceived spiritual importance.
As highlighted by MedPage Today, the ancient Greeks considered the heart the seat of the soul and a functional mechanism within the body. 
2. Medical limitations
Lack of anatomical understanding: For centuries, knowledge of the heart's anatomy and physiology remained limited, leading to misconceptions about its role and function.
Bleeding and lack of control: Cutting into the constantly beating heart caused profuse bleeding, which was almost impossible to manage before the development of modern surgical techniques and equipment.
Absence of bypass technology: Surgeons lacked a means to temporarily take over the heart's function during surgery, making any direct intervention on the beating heart fatal.
Fear of infection: The risk of infection during surgery was high, further contributing to the reluctance to operate on a vital organ like the heart. 
3. The rise of heart surgery and defying the taboo
Despite these challenges, daring pioneers like Dr. Dwight Harken began to experiment with procedures like removing shrapnel from the hearts of soldiers wounded in World War II, notes PBS.
The development of the heart-lung machine was a crucial breakthrough, as it allowed the heart to be stopped for surgery while the machine took over its vital functions.
Russell M. Nelson and his colleagues were part of the research team instrumental in developing and demonstrating the first successful use of the heart-lung machine, allowing surgeons to operate on the human heart.
According to the University of Utah School of Medicine, Nelson was taught in medical school that the human heart should never be touched. His own research was a direct challenge to these conventional beliefs.
These pioneering efforts challenged the deeply ingrained cultural and medical beliefs surrounding the heart, opening the door for the development of modern cardiac surgery and the treatment of a wide range of cardiovascular conditions. 
It is important to understand that the "untouchable" heart was a concept born from both practical limitations and deeply held beliefs. The dedication and courage of medical pioneers like Russell M. Nelson were essential in overcoming these barriers and transforming our understanding and ability to heal the human heart. 


Russell M. Nelson's book "The Power Within Us" (also known as "The Power is In Us") delves into the idea of the "untouchable" heart by reflecting on his experiences as a pioneering heart surgeon. He shares how, early in his medical education, he was taught that one must never touch the human heart or it would stop beating. This belief, rooted in both the limitations of surgical technology at the time and the traditional understanding of the heart's fragility, represented a significant barrier to the development of life-saving heart surgeries. 
However, Nelson was also deeply influenced by the scripture, "To every kingdom there is a law, and unto every law there are certain bounds also and conditions" (Doctrine and Covenants 88:38). He reasoned that if even the "kingdom" of the human heart was governed by laws, understanding and manipulating those laws could be key to healing it. 
This conviction motivated him and his research team to embark on groundbreaking experiments. They discovered that they could indeed touch the hearts of animals without stopping them, by carefully understanding and obeying the underlying physiological laws. This key insight, coupled with the development of the heart-lung machine, ultimately led to the first successful open-heart surgeries and revolutionized the field of cardiac surgery,
The principle of "laws governing kingdoms" extended beyond his medical practice to his spiritual understanding, emphasizing that blessings are predicated on obedience to divine laws.



Russell M. Nelson's pioneering work in heart surgery was driven by his belief that the human body, including the heart, operates under divine laws that can be understood and utilized for healing. He describes this journey in his book "The Power Within Us". 
1. The heart can be touched without stopping
A foundational belief in the early days of heart surgery was that touching the beating heart would immediately cause it to stop, says newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org.
However, through their initial research, Nelson and his colleagues discovered that this wasn't true. They found that the hearts of animals could be touched without losing their beat, opening the door for future advancements in cardiac surgery. 
2. Sodium/potassium balance and heartbeat regulation
Nelson and his team discovered that the beating of the heart could be temporarily and safely stopped by altering the balance of sodium and potassium in the blood flow to the coronary arteries.
Specifically, adding potassium chloride to the blood would cause the heart to stop beating instantly, allowing surgeons to perform delicate repairs on damaged valves or vessels, notes BYU Speeches.
Once the repairs were complete, restoring the normal sodium/potassium ratio in the blood would cause the heart to resume its normal beating pattern.
This understanding of the sodium/potassium ratio's impact on the heart's electrical activity and muscle contraction was a crucial discovery that enabled open-heart surgery to become a viable and life-saving procedure. 
3. Divine and irrefutable laws
These findings demonstrated a fundamental principle: the heart, like all "kingdoms" or systems, operates under specific and discernible laws.
Nelson emphasized that these laws are "divine law," meaning they are inherent to the creation and function of the human body and are consistent and reliable.
This realization bolstered his belief in a Creator and reinforced the idea that understanding and working with these laws, rather than against them, leads to positive outcomes and ultimately blessings, including the blessing of saved lives through surgical intervention. 
Nelson's medical discoveries were not just about mastering surgical techniques. They were rooted in a deeper understanding of the inherent laws governing the human heart, inspiring him to apply this perspective to his spiritual life as well.
