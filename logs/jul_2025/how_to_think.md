find out facts. evaluate them. form your own opinion 
Here’s a concise framework for the three levels of understanding, followed by a summary of Susan Wise Bauer’s The Well‑Educated Mind:

Three Levels of Understanding
Taste
– What it is: A first encounter—skimming or sampling the outline of an idea.
– Goal: Get the gist. Recognize the topic, scope, and key terms.

Swallow
– What it is: Delving deeper—examining the facts, arguments, and evidence.
– Goal: Ask “Is it true? How do I know?” Validate sources, test logic, compare perspectives.

Digest
– What it is: Internalizing or rejecting—folding the idea into your worldview.
– Goal: Let it reshape your thinking (or discard it if it falls short). Form your own, well‑informed opinion.

## Summary: The Well‑Educated Mind

Susan Wise Bauer’s The Well‑Educated Mind is a guide for adults who want to revive the classical habit of reading “great books” with purpose and skill. Its core lessons:

A Systematic Reading Plan

Genres to cover: History, Biography, Philosophy, Poetry, Fiction, Drama, and Fine Arts.

Why: Each genre trains a different part of the mind—contextual thinking, moral reasoning, emotional intelligence, aesthetic judgment.

Four Stages of Active Reading

Inspectional (Taste): Survey the work—titles, headings, summary—to form a roadmap.

Analytical (Swallow): Break the argument into parts. Identify thesis, evidence, assumptions, and implications.

Interpretive: Ask probing questions—“What does this mean? What’s the author’s purpose?”

Syntopical (Digest): Compare across texts. Weave together multiple viewpoints into a synthesized, personal understanding.

Tools for Critical Engagement

Annotation: Mark passages, jot questions in margins.

Note‑taking: Summaries, outlines, and concept maps to track structure and your reactions.

Discussion: Talking through ideas with others to test and refine your judgments.

Building Intellectual Habits

Consistency: Short, daily reading sessions keep ideas alive in your mind.

Reflection: Regularly revisit notes and ask how new insights fit (or conflict) with your existing beliefs.

Growth: Over time, you’ll move from merely appreciating great works to contributing your own, well‑reasoned perspectives.

Putting It Together:

Taste = Inspectional Reading

Swallow = Analytical & Interpretive Reading

Digest = Syntopical Reading & Personal Integration

By following Bauer’s roadmap, you learn not just what to read but how to read—so that every book you tackle can transform your mind, one level at a time.







Discover Your Genius by Michael J. Gelb is a guided workbook that helps you unlock your innate creativity by studying the minds of ten history‑making geniuses. Gelb argues that “genius” isn’t an inborn gift reserved for the few but a set of attitudes and practices anyone can cultivate through focused study, self‑assessment, and deliberate exercises (HarperCollins).
The book is structured around ten “genius profiles,” each pairing a brief biography with a targeted self‑reflection and practical exercises. The ten figures and their corresponding insights are:
* Plato — Deepening your love of wisdom
* Filippo Brunelleschi — Expanding your perspective
* Christopher Columbus — Strengthening vision, optimism, and courage
* Nicolaus Copernicus — Reorganizing your worldview
* Queen Elizabeth I — Wielding power with balance and effectiveness
* William Shakespeare — Cultivating emotional intelligence
* Thomas Jefferson — Celebrating freedom in the pursuit of happiness
* Charles Darwin — Honing powers of observation and an open mind
* Mahatma Gandhi — Harmonizing spirit, mind, and body through spiritual genius
* Albert Einstein — Unleashing imagination and “combinatory play” (Barnes & Noble).
Core themes and takeaways:
1. Cultivate Curiosity — Like Plato, foster an insatiable passion for learning.
2. Shift Perspectives — Emulate Brunelleschi’s daring reframing of problems to uncover novel solutions.
3. Vision with Courage — Adopt Columbus’s optimism in charting unexplored territory.
4. Challenge Paradigms — Follow Copernicus in questioning entrenched beliefs and redefining your worldview.
5. Balanced Leadership — Learn from Elizabeth I how to combine authority with diplomacy.
6. Emotional Mastery — Practice Shakespeare’s nuanced understanding of human motivations.
7. Freedom of Thought — Jefferson reminds us that intellectual liberty fuels innovation.
8. Observational Rigor — Darwin’s meticulous attention to detail teaches rigorous inquiry.
9. Integrative Spirit — Gandhi models how inner harmony underpins effective action.
10. Imaginative Play — Einstein shows that playful experimentation ignites breakthroughs (Barnes & Noble).
Through reflective questions, creative “mental play” exercises, and self‑assessments, Gelb provides a clear roadmap for readers to identify which “genius traits” they most need to develop—and how to practice them in daily life. In essence, Discover Your Genius is both a historical tour of revolutionary minds and a hands‑on manual for transforming your own thinking, creativity, and problem‑solving abilities (HarperCollins).

2:10
Since then, the gains in what is called reinforcement learning,
2:13
which is what AlphaGo helped invent and so forth,
2:16
allow us to do planning.
2:19
And a good example is look at OpenAI o3
2:23
or DeepSeek R1,
2:25
and you can see how it goes forward and back,
2:28
forward and back, forward and back.
2:30
It's extraordinary.
2:32
In my case, I bought a rocket company
2:34
because it was like, interesting.
2:36
BS: (Laughs) As one does.
2:38
ES: As one does.
2:39
And it’s an area that I’m not an expert in,
2:42
and I want to be an expert.
2:43
So I'm using deep research.
2:45
And these systems are spending 15 minutes writing these deep papers.
2:49
That's true for most of them.
2:51
Do you have any idea how much computation
2:53
15 minutes of these supercomputers is?
2:56
It's extraordinary.
2:57
So you’re seeing the arrival,
2:59
the shift from language to language.
3:01
Tthen you had language to sequence,
3:03
which is how biology is done.
3:05
Now you're doing essentially planning and strategy.
3:09
The eventual state of this
3:11
is the computers running all business processes, right?
3:14
So you have an agent to do this, an agent to do this,
3:17
an agent to do this.
3:19
And you concatenate them together,
3:20
and they speak language among each other.
3:23
They typically speak English language.
Scale
3:26
BS: I mean, speaking of just the sheer compute requirements of these systems,
3:31
let's talk about scale briefly.
3:33
You know, I kind of think of these AI systems as Hungry Hungry Hippos.
3:36
They seemingly soak up all the data and compute that we throw at them.
3:40
They've already digested all the tokens on the public internet,
3:43
and it seems we can't build data centers fast enough.
3:47
What do you think the real limits are,
3:49
and how do we get ahead of them
3:51
before they start throttling AI progress?
3:54
ES: So there's a real limit in energy.
3:56
Give you an example.
3:57
There's one calculation,
3:58
and I testified on this this week in Congress,
4:01
that we need another 90 gigawatts of power in America.
4:06
My answer, by the way, is, think Canada, right?
4:10
Nice people, full of hydroelectric power.
4:12
But that's apparently not the political mood right now.
4:16
Sorry.
4:17
So 90 gigawatts is 90 nuclear power plants in America.
4:22
Not happening.
4:24
We're building zero, right?
4:25
How are we going to get all that power?
4:27
This is a major, major national issue.
4:30
You can use the Arab world,
4:31
which is busy building five to 10 gigawatts of data centers.
4:35
India is considering a 10-gigawatt data center.
4:38
To understand how big gigawatts are,
4:41
is think cities per data center.
4:44
That's how much power these things need.
4:46
And the people look at it and they say,
4:48
“Well, there’s lots of algorithmic improvements,
4:51
and you will need less power."
4:53
There's an old rule, I'm old enough to remember, right?
4:57
Grove giveth, Gates taketh away.
5:00
OK, the hardware just gets faster and faster.
5:03
The physicists are amazing.
5:06
Just incredible what they've been able to do.
5:08
And us software people, we just use it and use it and use it.
5:12
And when you look at planning, at least in today's algorithms,
5:15
it's back and forth and try this and that
5:18
and just watch it yourself.
5:20
There are estimates, and you know this from Andreessen Horowitz reports,
5:24
it's been well studied,
5:26
that there's an increase in at least a factor of 100,
5:29
maybe a factor of 1,000,
5:30
in computation required just to do the kind of planning.
5:34
The technology goes from essentially deep learning to reinforcement learning
5:38
to something called test-time compute,
5:40
where not only are you doing planning,
5:42
but you're also learning while you're doing planning.
5:45
That is the, if you will,
5:46
the zenith or what have you, of computation needs.
5:50
That's problem number one, electricity and hardware.
5:53
Problem number two is we ran out of data
5:57
so we have to start generating it.
5:59
But we can easily do that because that's one of the functions.
6:01
And then the third question that I don't understand
6:04
is what's the limit of knowledge?
6:07
I'll give you an example.
6:08
Let's imagine we are collectively all of the computers in the world,
6:11
and we're all thinking
6:13
and we're all thinking based on knowledge that exists that was previously invented.
6:17
How do we invent something completely new?
6:21
So, Einstein.
6:23
So when you study the way scientific discovery works,
6:26
biology, math, so forth and so on,
6:28
what typically happens is a truly brilliant human being
6:32
looks at one area and says,
6:35
"I see a pattern
6:37
that's in a completely different area,
6:38
has nothing to do with the first one.
6:40
It's the same pattern."
6:42
And they take the tools from one and they apply it to another.
6:45
Today, our systems cannot do that.
6:48
If we can get through that, I'm working on this,
6:51
a general technical term for this is non-stationarity of objectives.
6:56
The rules keep changing.
6:58
We will see if we can solve that problem.
7:00
If we can solve that, we're going to need even more data centers.
7:03
And we'll also be able to invent completely new schools of scientific
7:08
and intellectual thought,
7:10
which will be incredible.
Autonomy
7:11
BS: So as we push towards a zenith,
7:13
autonomy has been a big topic of discussion.
7:16
Yoshua Bengio gave a compelling talk earlier this week,
7:19
advocating that AI labs should halt the development of agentic AI systems
7:23
that are capable of taking autonomous action.
7:25
Yet that is precisely what the next frontier is for all these AI labs,
7:30
and seemingly for yourself, too.
7:32
What is the right decision here?
7:33
ES: So Yoshua is a brilliant inventor of much of what we're talking about
7:38
and a good personal friend.
7:39
And we’ve talked about this, and his concerns are very legitimate.
7:43
The question is not are his concerns right,
7:45
but what are the solutions?
7:47
So let's think about agents.
7:49
So for purposes of argument, everyone in the audience is an agent.
7:53
You have an input that's English or whatever language.
7:56
And you have an output that’s English, and you have memory,
7:59
which is true of all humans.
8:01
Now we're all busy working,
8:02
and all of a sudden, one of you decides
8:06
it's much more efficient not to use human language,
8:09
but we'll invent our own computer language.
8:11
Now you and I are sitting here, watching all of this,
8:14
and we're saying, like, what do we do now?
8:16
The correct answer is unplug you, right?
8:19
Because we're not going to know,
8:22
we're just not going to know what you're up to.
8:25
And you might actually be doing something really bad or really amazing.
8:28
We want to be able to watch.
