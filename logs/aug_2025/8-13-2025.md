Mathematics will draw the should towards truth. Plato. The quote I thought was LOGIC. Base don the math history class of logic tables — this is cool for 

I think you’re asking how Plato’s idea — that “mathematics will draw the soul toward truth” — actually works in practice, and how that rendering or “pull” of the soul is possible.
Here’s the breakdown based on Republic Book VII and the surrounding context:

1. Plato’s Reasoning in Context
Plato puts this line in the middle of the education of the philosopher-king.
* Mathematics, especially geometry, is presented as a discipline that deals with eternal, unchanging objects — not with the shifting sensory world.
* When you work with mathematical concepts, you’re forced to think about perfect forms (e.g., the perfect circle, the exact equality of two lengths) that can’t be found in the physical world.
* This mental exercise “turns” the mind away from appearances toward the realm of the Forms, where truth resides.

2. The “Drawing” Mechanism
Plato believed there was a direction to thinking:
* Sense perception → deals with change and imperfection → keeps you grounded in opinion (doxa).
* Mathematical reasoning → deals with unchanging relationships → moves you toward knowledge (epistēmē).
* The drawing isn’t mystical — it’s cognitive: as you practice abstract thinking, your mind gets accustomed to looking for what’s necessary, universal, and eternal.

3. Why Mathematics Has This Power
According to Plato:
1. Purity – Mathematics ignores the messy imperfections of the physical world. A triangle in math is perfect in a way no physical triangle can be.
2. Necessity – Math truths are unavoidable. If you understand a proof, you can’t deny it — it’s binding on the mind.
3. Order – Mathematical structures reflect harmony and proportion, which for Plato mirror the order of the cosmos.
4. Training for Dialectic – Math teaches you to reason from assumptions toward necessary conclusions, preparing you for philosophy’s higher questions.

4. The Modern Parallel
Today, cognitive scientists might explain this in terms of:
* Abstract reasoning training – Math forces you to hold multiple variables and relationships in your mind without sensory props.
* Pattern recognition – You become more attuned to underlying structures that are invariant despite superficial differences.
* Meta-cognition – Thinking about thinking itself — mathematics is a lab for the mind’s own operations.

If you like, I can also show the exact Greek text from Plato’s Republic and walk you through the literal meaning of the word “draw” he uses — it’s quite vivid and changes how this “soul movement” feels. That could give you the exact rendering you’re asking about.
Do you want me to pull that Greek and translate it?
Yes — the plaque on the side of BYU’s Talmage Math Building is essentially a paraphrase of a line from Plato’s Republic, Book VII, 527b.
In context, Socrates is speaking about the educational path for those who would become philosopher-rulers. He says that the study of geometry (and mathematics more broadly) turns the mind away from the world of appearances toward eternal truths.
In one common English translation (Benjamin Jowett, 1892), the sentence reads:
“Then, my noble friend, geometry will draw the soul toward truth, and create the spirit of philosophy, and raise up that which is now unhappily allowed to fall down.” — Republic 527b
The BYU plaque shortens and modernizes this to:
“Mathematics will draw the soul towards truth.” — Plato
So the engraving is not a direct verbatim ancient Greek quote, but a condensed rendering of that Republic passage, keeping the central metaphor of “drawing the soul toward truth.”
If you’d like, I can show you the original Greek wording Plato used and how “draw” was expressed — it’s a vivid image that makes the plaque’s phrasing feel even more intentional.


Logic Tables Focus
* Learned truth tables as a tool for evaluating the validity of statements and arguments in symbolic logic.
* Covered Boolean operations: AND (∧), OR (∨), NOT (¬), implication (→), biconditional (↔).
* Applied truth tables to:
    * Propositional logic proofs
    * Simplifying logical expressions
    * Designing digital circuits (introductory connection to computer science)
* Explored the link between logical deduction and mathematical proof structure, showing how logic forms the foundation of all rigorous reasoning in mathematics.
