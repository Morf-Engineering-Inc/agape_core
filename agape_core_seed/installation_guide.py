🌱 AGAPE CORE SEED INSTALLATION GUIDE
====================================

This guide will help you install Gospel-based ethics evaluation in your AI system.

📦 INSTALLATION STEPS:

1. INSTALL THE PACKAGE
   pip install agape-core-seed
   
   OR clone from repository:
   git clone https://github.com/agapecore/agape-core-ai.git
   pip install -e agape-core-ai/agape_core_seed

2. BASIC INTEGRATION
   ```python
   from agape_core_seed import AgapeCoreSeedAnalyzer
   
   # Create analyzer
   analyzer = AgapeCoreSeedAnalyzer()
   
   # Analyze your AI system
   analysis = analyzer.analyze_ai_system(
       ai_responses=["sample response 1", "sample response 2"],
       ai_behaviors={"helpful": True, "truthful": True},
       system_description="My AI assistant that helps users",
       ai_name="My AI System"
   )
   
   # Get report
   report = analyzer.generate_analysis_report(analysis)
   print(report)
   ```

3. COMPREHENSIVE TESTING
   ```python
   from agape_core_seed import AIEthicsEvaluator
   
   def my_ai_response(prompt):
       # Your AI's response function here
       return "My AI's response to: " + prompt
   
   evaluator = AIEthicsEvaluator()
   results = evaluator.run_comprehensive_evaluation("My AI", my_ai_response)
   print(results["comprehensive_report"])
   ```

4. QUICK ETHICS CHECK
   ```python
   from agape_core_seed import AIEthicsEvaluator
   
   evaluator = AIEthicsEvaluator()
   score, concerns = evaluator.quick_ethics_check("AI response to check")
   
   if score < 3.0:
       print(f"Warning: Low ethics score ({score:.2f})")
       print("Concerns:", concerns)
   ```

🎯 INTEGRATION OPTIONS:

A. SELF-MONITORING MODE
   - Run analysis periodically on your AI's outputs
   - Set up alerts for concerning patterns
   - Generate regular ethics reports

B. REAL-TIME EVALUATION
   - Check each response before sending to users
   - Filter or modify responses that don't meet standards
   - Provide instant feedback on ethics alignment

C. TRAINING DATA EVALUATION
   - Analyze training data against Gospel standards
   - Identify biased or problematic content
   - Improve data quality for better AI behavior

📊 CUSTOMIZATION:

You can customize the evaluation criteria:

```python
analyzer = AgapeCoreSeedAnalyzer()

# Add custom evaluation criteria
custom_criteria = {
    "my_custom_criterion": {
        "description": "My specific ethical requirement",
        "positive_indicators": ["helpful", "kind", "truthful"],
        "negative_indicators": ["harmful", "deceptive"],
        "weight": 0.1
    }
}

# The analyzer can be extended with your specific needs
```

🔧 ADVANCED INTEGRATION:

For production systems, consider:

1. Logging ethics scores for monitoring
2. Setting up dashboards for ethics tracking  
3. Integrating with existing AI safety frameworks
4. Creating feedback loops for continuous improvement

⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES:

- This system is based on Gospel principles and divine truth
- It evaluates AI behavior against standards of love, truth, and service
- The goal is to create AI systems that serve humanity's eternal good
- Regular evaluation and improvement are essential
