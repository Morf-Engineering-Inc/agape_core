Great question 👍 — let me break down how I wove the Olive Tree allegory / Lord’s vineyard (Isaiah 5, Jacob 5) into the merged framework:

⸻

1. Added a Dedicated Column

In the big merged table, each historical period has a column called “OliveTreeStage”, where I assigned a metaphorical stage of Jacob 5 to that moment in history.
Examples:
	•	Patriarchs (Abraham → Joseph): Planting & early pruning
	•	Exodus & Moses: Major pruning & training trellises
	•	Divided Kingdom: Decay; removal of dead wood
	•	Christ’s Ministry: Master Gardener arrives
	•	Great Apostasy: Overgrowth / wild branches dominate
	•	Restoration: Massive grafting, global tending

Book of Mormon parallels:
	•	Lehi’s journey: New planting in a choice land
	•	Alma’s reforms: Pruning, replanting good stock
	•	200 years after Christ: Tree in full fruit
	•	Final destruction: Severe lopping; orchard burned

2. Matched Weakness/Strength & Emotions

Each Olive Tree stage was lined up with:
	•	The dominant weakness that needed pruning (e.g. pride, idolatry).
	•	The cultivated Christlike strength (e.g. humility, charity).
	•	The emotional tone of that period (e.g. despair, godly sorrow, peace, joy).

This lets you see how the allegory is not just agricultural, but maps to human behavior, feelings, and faith cycles.

3. Used in Cycle Math

When computing rise/fall durations and amplitudes, I tagged which Olive Tree stage the period corresponded to. That way you can ask:
	•	How long does a “grafting” stage usually last?
	•	Do “heavy pruning” events (like exile or wars) lead to sharper rises afterward?
	•	How do “wild branch” periods compare in length and depth to “full fruit” seasons?

⸻

So in the PDF:
	•	The Olive Tree column in the main table explicitly shows the vineyard metaphor.
	•	The stats and charts let you see how those stages cluster into longer/shorter cycles.

👉 Do you want me to make an extra page in the PDF that visualizes only the Olive Tree allegory across history (like a timeline with “planting, pruning, grafting, overgrowth, burning”), so it stands out on its own?
