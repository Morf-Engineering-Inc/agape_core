I built a single merged framework that aligns:
	•	historical periods (Bible, Book of Mormon, Restoration),
	•	a heuristic faithfulness index (0–100) to capture “rise/fall,”
	•	dominant human weaknesses vs Christlike strengths,
	•	prevailing emotional tone (natural → sanctified),
	•	and the Olive Tree/Vineyard metaphor stages (Isaiah 5; Jacob 5).

What you can open now
	•	I placed the full merged table in a spreadsheet-style view so you can sort/filter.
	•	I also added two simple charts (Bible→Restoration arc, and Book of Mormon arc), and two stats tables.

Open these:
	•	Merged Gospel/Weakness/Emotion/Olive-Tree Table (Illustrative)
	•	Cycle Stats by Tradition (Illustrative)
	•	Up vs Down Cycle Stats (Illustrative)

How to read this
	•	Faithfulness Index (0–100): a modeling tool (not doctrine) to make patterns comparable across eras. Rises/falls match narrative arcs (e.g., Judges’ cycles, Nephite pride cycles, Apostasy→Restoration).
	•	Olive Tree mapping:
	•	Planting/early pruning (new covenants, foundations)
	•	Grafting (missionary expansion, gathering)
	•	Overgrowth/wild branches (corruption, pride)
	•	Heavy pruning/lopping (chastening, captivity, war)
	•	Soil renewal (reform, return)
	•	Full fruit (Zion-like unity)
	•	Burning/clearing (final judgments)

These stages are assigned for each period so you can trace Jacob 5’s allegory over time.

Initial mathematical takeaways (from the tables)

These numbers are illustrative and based on widely used approximate dates (BCE negative, CE positive). They’re a scaffold for deeper work, not a claim of exact chronology.

	•	Average cycle durations (from the stats table):
	•	Old Testament “ups” and “downs” cluster around 150–250 years per phase.
	•	Book of Mormon shows faster oscillations with a ~100–200 year “rise,” then a ~100 year decline to collapse (300–385 CE).
	•	The Great Apostasy is a long “down” tail (~1,700 years), followed by a Restoration rise now at ~205 years (1820–2025).
	•	Amplitude of swings (Δ Faithfulness):
	•	“Down” phases generally have larger negative swings than “up” phases gain, unless accompanied by “heavy pruning + soil renewal” events (Moses’ reforms; post-exilic return; 34–~200 CE Nephite Zion).
	•	This aligns with Jacob 5: deep pruning and careful tending precede seasons of abundant fruit.
	•	Shape patterns you can test further:
	1.	Damped cycles under righteous leadership (e.g., united monarchy uptrend, then decay when pride/inequality set in).
	2.	Shock–reset pattern: captivity/exile/war acts like a reset → short sharp rise (post-exile, Alma’s church, Christ’s visit), then gradual drift.
	3.	Asymmetric cycles: declines are often gradual then sudden (long drift down → rapid collapse), while restorations are sudden then gradual (quick rise with reform/visitation → long plateaus of tending).

Next steps (I can do this now if you want)
	1.	Refine the faithfulness curve
	•	If you want, give me a few anchor points (scripture passages or dates you care about most), and I’ll recalibrate the 0–100 values around those anchors for a tighter fit.
	2.	Add Adam→Enoch/Zion and other early epochs
	•	I left truly ancient/undated periods out of the math because the years aren’t standardized. If you’re okay with a theological timeline (not historical consensus), I can add “Adam→Enoch (Zion) → Flood” as undated or symbolic spans and keep them in the same comparative structure.
	3.	Crosswalk to specific verses
	•	I can append columns with references (Isaiah 5, Jacob 5, Alma, Helaman, 3 Nephi, etc.) so each row links to passages backing the assigned olive-tree stage.
	4.	Export
	•	I can export the merged table to CSV/Excel and a printable PDF with the two charts.

If you want any of those, tell me which to prioritize and I’ll generate them right away. ￼
