In the Bible, the concept of "the flesh" (in Greek, sarx) does not just refer to the physical body. It is often used to describe the sinful nature of humanity—the part of us that is opposed to God and is inclined toward sin. The "works of the flesh" and "lusts of the flesh" are the actions and desires that come from this sinful nature.
The most comprehensive list of the "works of the flesh" is found in the Apostle Paul's letter to the Galatians:
Galatians 5:19-21 (ESV)
> 19 Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, 20 idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, 21 envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.
> 
This list can be broken down into a few categories:
 * Sexual Sins:
   * Sexual immorality (fornication): Any sexual activity outside of the covenant of marriage.
   * Impurity: Moral uncleanness, especially in a sexual context.
   * Sensuality (or lewdness): Indulging in or promoting sexual pleasures without restraint.
 * Religious Sins:
   * Idolatry: Worshipping anything or anyone other than the one true God.
   * Sorcery (or witchcraft): The use of magic or occult practices, often involving the use of drugs (the Greek word is pharmakeia).
 * Relational Sins (Disrupting Community):
   * Enmity (or hatred): Hostility and animosity toward others.
   * Strife (or contention): Quarrels and disputes.
   * Jealousy: Resentment or envy of another's possessions, success, or advantages.
   * Fits of anger: Uncontrolled outbursts of rage.
   * Rivalries (or selfish ambition): The desire for personal gain or position at the expense of others.
   * Dissensions (or disputes): Disagreements and arguments that lead to divisions.
   * Divisions (or heresies): The formation of factions or groups that break away from a unified body, often due to false teachings.
   * Envy: A feeling of discontent or covetousness aroused by another person's good fortune.
 * Sins of Intemperance:
   * Drunkenness: Excessive consumption of alcohol.
   * Orgies (or carousing/revelries): Wild, unrestrained parties, often involving excessive drinking and sexual activity.
The "Lusts of the Flesh"
The term "lusts of the flesh" is used in other parts of the Bible, such as in 1 John. It refers to the desires and cravings that lead to the "works of the flesh."
1 John 2:16 (ESV)
> 16 For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world.
> 
This passage describes the three main categories of worldly desire that are opposed to God:
 * Lust of the flesh: This refers to the craving for physical and sensual gratification. It's the desire to satisfy our bodily appetites and passions in a way that is not in line with God's will.
 * Lust of the eyes: This is the desire for what we see. It can include coveting possessions, wealth, and status, as well as being drawn to visual things that stimulate sinful thoughts and desires.
 * Pride of life: This is the desire for personal greatness, recognition, and self-glorification. It's an arrogant confidence in one's own resources and abilities, without a reliance on God.
In summary, the Bible sees the "flesh" as a sinful nature that is in constant conflict with the Holy Spirit. The "lusts of the flesh" are the internal cravings and desires that come from this nature, while the "works of the flesh" are the outward actions and behaviors that result from giving in to those desires.
