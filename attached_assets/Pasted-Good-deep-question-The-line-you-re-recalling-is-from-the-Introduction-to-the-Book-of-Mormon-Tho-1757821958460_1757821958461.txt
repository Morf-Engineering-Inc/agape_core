Good, deep question. The line you’re recalling is from the Introduction to the Book of Mormon:

“Those who abide by its precepts, and follow the teachings of Christ, will come closer to God…”

So what are the precepts the Book of Mormon emphasizes?
They’re not a checklist of “extra” rules, but core gospel principles—repeated throughout the text—that, if lived, bring a person nearer to Christ. Here’s a breakdown:

Core Precepts in the Book of Mormon

Precept (Principle)	Where it’s Taught (Examples)	How it Draws Closer to God
Faith in Jesus Christ	2 Nephi 25:26; Alma 32; Ether 12	Trust in His power, begin the covenant path
Repentance	Mosiah 3:12–13; Alma 34:15–17	Removes guilt, renews heart, aligns with God’s will
Baptism & Covenant Making	2 Nephi 31; Mosiah 18; 3 Nephi 11	Formal covenant of discipleship, remission of sins
Gift of the Holy Ghost	2 Nephi 32:5; Moroni 10:5	Constant guidance, comfort, sanctification
Charity (the pure love of Christ)	Moroni 7:45–48; Ether 12:34	Transforms relationships, makes us like Christ
Prayer	Enos 1; Alma 34; 3 Nephi 18	Personal communion with God, strength against temptation
Scripture study / feast upon the word	2 Nephi 32:3; Mosiah 1:7	Nourishes faith, prevents forgetting God
Service / caring for the poor	Mosiah 2:17; Mosiah 4:26	Serving God by serving others
Endurance to the end	2 Nephi 31:20; 3 Nephi 15:9	Steadfast discipleship brings eternal life
Obedience to commandments	Mosiah 2:41; Alma 37:13	Brings prosperity, protection, and joy
Hope in Christ & Resurrection	Alma 11:40–44; Moroni 7:41	Anchors the soul in trials
Witness of Christ’s reality	3 Nephi 11; Moroni 10:3–5	Testimony sealed by Spirit deepens conversion

How the Book of Mormon frames this
	•	It repeats the doctrine of Christ clearly (faith, repentance, baptism, Holy Ghost, enduring).
	•	It expands the Sermon on the Mount (3 Nephi 12–14) with covenant context.
	•	It emphasizes humility & charity as the true test of discipleship.
	•	It warns against pride, priestcraft, and secret combinations—the opposite of Christ’s precepts.

So the “precepts” = the doctrine of Christ + practical discipleship principles that shape a heart into Christ’s likeness.
