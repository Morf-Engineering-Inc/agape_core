Got it ‚Äî you‚Äôre asking for a structured way to look at the rise and fall of gospel faithfulness across history, the spectrum of human weakness and Christlike strengths, and the spectrum of human emotions, so that you can compare them side-by-side in tables.

Here‚Äôs a first framework you can build on:

‚∏ª

1. Rise and Falls of the Gospel (Patterns of Apostasy & Restoration)

We can chart these in terms of ‚Äúfaithfulness level‚Äù over time.

Period	Key Figures / Events	Pattern (Rise/Fall)	Notes
Adam ‚Üí Noah	Adam, Enoch, Noah	Rise under Enoch (Zion), fall before the flood	Righteous city translated; widespread wickedness destroyed in flood
Noah ‚Üí Abraham	Noah‚Äôs posterity, Tower of Babel	Partial rise with covenant line, fall with scattering	Gospel preserved through Shem, Abraham chosen
Abraham ‚Üí Moses	Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses	Rise in covenant family, fall into Egyptian bondage	Restoration through Moses & Law
Moses ‚Üí Judges ‚Üí Kings	Israel in wilderness, judges, kings	Cycles of rise/fall	Obedience brings prosperity, idolatry brings captivity
Prophets ‚Üí Babylonian captivity ‚Üí return	Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah	Rise with prophetic calls, fall into captivity	Partial restoration but expectation of Messiah
Christ & Apostles	Jesus Christ, Peter, Paul, John	Highest rise (full gospel), fall (Great Apostasy)	Church established, apostasy after apostles killed
Book of Mormon peoples	Nephi, Alma, Captain Moroni, Mormon, Moroni	Cycles of rise/fall	Ends in destruction of Nephites
Restoration to Present	Joseph Smith ‚Üí modern day church	Rise at Restoration, mixed faithfulness today	Still ongoing; prophecy of global gospel spread

2. Spectrum of Human Weakness vs Christlike Strengths

This table shows the mortal weakness ‚Üí Christlike opposite.

Human Weakness (Mortality)	Christlike Strength (Gospel Ideal)
Pride	Humility
Fear	Faith
Anger	Patience
Greed	Generosity
Lust	Purity
Sloth	Diligence
Doubt	Hope
Hatred	Charity (Love)
Selfishness	Service
Despair	Joy


‚∏ª

3. Spectrum of Human Emotions

This looks at emotions in their fallen vs sanctified form.

Negative / Natural Emotions	Neutral / Human Experience	Sanctified / Christlike Emotions
Despair	Sadness	Hope
Fear	Caution	Faith
Anger	Passion / Energy	Righteous Zeal
Shame	Guilt (teaches)	Godly Sorrow (repentance)
Envy	Desire	Righteous Aspiration
Hatred	Dislike	Charity (Love)
Apathy	Contentment	Peace
Anxiety	Concern	Trust in God
Pride	Confidence	Humility with divine strength
Loneliness	Longing	Communion with God/others


‚∏ª

üëâ When you put these three tables side-by-side, you can see how:
	‚Ä¢	History shows collective rises and falls.
	‚Ä¢	Weakness/strength spectrum shows personal transformation.
	‚Ä¢	Emotions spectrum shows inner sanctification.

Do you want me to merge all three into a single comparative table (like history events vs weakness vs emotion stage), or do you want them kept separate but aligned for comparison?
