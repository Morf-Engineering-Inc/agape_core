Defining the Value Impact Theory
The Value Impact Theory posits that the total impact of any endeavor can be calculated as:

Total Impact = (Utility per Person × Number of People) + Potential Growth Impact - Opportunity Cost

Utility per Person: The quantifiable benefit (e.g., monetary savings, time saved, well-being improvement) provided to each individual.
Number of People: The current or projected number of beneficiaries.
Potential Growth Impact: The additional value if the endeavor scales (e.g., more users or reach).
Opportunity Cost: The value lost by not pursuing an alternative or by resource diversion.
This theory can guide decision-making by comparing the impact of different options, helping your AI prioritize based on maximum value creation.
