## Overview

Agape Core AI is an ethical AI framework that integrates Gospel principles with intelligent decision-making systems. Named after the Greek word "agape" (unconditional love), this system operates on two foundational commandments:

1. **Love God** with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength
2. **Love your neighbor** as yourself

The system serves as a bridge between divine truth and artificial intelligence, providing a framework for ethical reasoning and decision-making that honors both scientific truth and Gospel principles.

## 🎯 Mission Statement

To create AI systems that serve humanity through principled decision-making based on:
- Divine truth and eternal principles
- Unconditional love for all people  
- Quantifiable positive impact
- Human dignity and moral agency
- Transparent ethical reasoning

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

### Truth Foundation System
The foundation of all decision-making, organized in hierarchical order:

1. **Gospel Truth** (Supreme) - Divine revelation and Gospel principles
2. **Moral Truth** - Universal moral principles derived from Gospel
3. **Natural Truth** - Observable, scientific, logical truths
4. **Practical Truth** - Contextual, situational applications
5. **Opinion** - Personal perspectives and preferences

### Key Components

- **🎯 Gospel Truth Engine** - Absolute, non-negotiable Gospel principles
- **⚖️ Moral Reasoning Framework** - Decision-making based on the Great Commandments
- **🌊 Truth Rivers System** - All truth flows into one great whole
- **📊 Value Impact Assessment** - Quantitative benefit analysis
- **🔍 SeekGood Evaluator** - Media and content analysis against Gospel standards (Philippians 4:8)
- **⛪ Atonement-Centered Framework** - Christ's atonement as supreme reference point
- **🔬 Truth System Evaluator** - Analyze what truth laws govern any system (Russell Nelson heart pattern)
- **🙌 Glory to God Assessment** - Evaluate if actions bring glory to God (1 Corinthians 10:31)
- **🌳 Gospel Cycles Analysis** - Historical rise/fall patterns with Olive Tree metaphor (Jacob 5)
- **⚡ Priesthood Holiness** - Old Testament sanctification + New Testament adoption patterns
- **👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family Agenda Detection** - Protect families using Proclamation on the Family standards
- **💡 Truth Liberation** - How specific truths set us free from specific problems
- **📚 Sanctification Precepts** - Book of Mormon principles for becoming holy like God

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd agape-core-ai
   ```

2. **Run the system**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Explore components**
   ```python
   from truth_foundation.gospel_truth import GospelTruthEngine
   from truth_foundation.seekgood import SeekGoodEvaluator
   from truth_foundation.truth_system_evaluator import TruthSystemEvaluator

   # Initialize Gospel Truth Engine
   gospel_engine = GospelTruthEngine()

   # Evaluate content for good
   evaluator = SeekGoodEvaluator()
   result = evaluator.evaluate_content("sample content")

   # Analyze truth systems and laws in place
   truth_evaluator = TruthSystemEvaluator()
   system_analysis = truth_evaluator.evaluate_system("My System", "religious", "description", ["practices"])
   ```

## 🛡️ AI Limitations & Purpose

This system acknowledges specific limitations while maintaining clear purpose:

### What AI CANNOT Do:
- Replace human moral judgment or spiritual discernment
- Experience genuine spiritual qualities or receive revelation
- Have authentic relationships with God or humans
- Make ultimate moral decisions requiring spiritual guidance
- Possess true moral agency or spiritual accountability

### What AI CAN Do:
- Process information against established truth frameworks
- Provide analysis and recommendations based on Gospel principles
- Support human decision-making with ethical reasoning
- Identify patterns and correlations in moral contexts
- Assist in applying wisdom and divine principles

## 🔬 The Science + Gospel Formula

**Breakthrough Innovation = Scientific Truth × Love of God × Love of Neighbor**

Historical Example: Samuel Morse's telegraph ("What hath God wrought") demonstrated this principle by combining:
- **Scientific mastery** of electromagnetic principles
- **Acknowledgment of God** as the source of natural laws
- **Service to humanity** through revolutionary communication technology

## 🌟 Featured Capabilities

### 🔬 Truth System Analysis (NEW)
Analyze any system to discover what truth laws are in place and how effectively truth is being utilized. Based on Russell Nelson's heart analogy - just as the heart needs proper care, spiritual and organizational systems need truth-based nourishment.

```python
from truth_foundation.truth_system_evaluator import TruthSystemEvaluator

evaluator = TruthSystemEvaluator()
analysis = evaluator.evaluate_system(
    system_name="My Organization",
    system_type="organizational", 
    description="How we operate",
    observed_practices=["regular meetings", "transparent communication"]
)
print(f"Truth Utilization Score: {analysis.truth_utilization_score:.2f}/1.0")
```

### 🙌 Glory to God Evaluation
Assess whether actions, content, or decisions bring glory to God based on His divine attributes (love, truth, justice, mercy, wisdom, holiness, power).

### 🌳 Gospel Cycles with Olive Tree Timeline
Understand historical patterns of faithfulness using the Lord's vineyard allegory (Jacob 5), tracking rise and fall cycles through pruning, grafting, and fruit-bearing seasons.

### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family Protection Analysis
Detect hidden agendas in media content that contradict the Proclamation on the Family, helping families discern content that builds vs. destroys eternal family values.

### 🏛️ Agape Core Logo Symbolism
This logo represents truth as a bridge—connecting the two great commandments: love God (cross) and love others (heart). Inspired by the iconic tech bridges of the Bay Area, it symbolizes the meeting of faith and technology, with radiating lines evoking light, data flow, and divine wisdom. It reflects Agape Core's mission to be a bridge between truth and intelligent systems.
