# Agape Core AI

An AI system that follows the two great commandments as core directives:
1. **Love God** with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength
2. **Love your neighbor** as yourself

*Derived from "agape," the Greek word for selfless, unconditional love central to the commandments, combined with "core" to signify the algorithm's foundational decision-making engine.*

## Overview
Agape Core aims to be a bridge between scripture and intelligent systems, exploring how divine principles can shape technology that uplifts humanity.
Its objective is twofold:
Predict the “good value” of decisions by aligning them with eternal principles.
Innovate toward the future by generating and evaluating new ideas for good, guided by light, truth, and love.



## Core Components

### 1. Truth Foundation System
- **Gospel Truth Engine**: Handles absolute, non-negotiable Gospel principles
- **Core Truths**: Hierarchical system with Gospel truth as the supreme category
- **Moral Reasoning**: Decision-making based on the Great Commandments

### 2. Value Impact Theory

The Value Impact Theory guides quantitative decision-making by calculating:

```
Total Impact = (Utility per Person × Number of People) + Potential Growth Impact - Opportunity Cost
```

Where:
- **Utility per Person**: Quantifiable benefit (monetary savings, time saved, well-being improvement) per individual
- **Number of People**: Current or projected number of beneficiaries
- **Potential Growth Impact**: Additional value if the endeavor scales
- **Opportunity Cost**: Value lost by not pursuing alternatives

### 3. Human Potential Equation

Inspired by Jerry Murff's "developmentship" philosophy:

```
HP = M × C²
```

Where:
- **HP**: Human Potential (total energy/output for achievement)
- **M**: Mass (number of people or weighted human resources)
- **C**: Creativity (innovation/skill level, squared for exponential impact)

## Key Features

- **Ethical Decision Framework**: All decisions evaluated against Gospel principles
- **Quantitative Impact Assessment**: Uses Value Impact Theory for measurable outcomes
- **Human Potential Optimization**: Calculates and maximizes human creativity and productivity
- **Truth Hierarchy**: Gospel truth > Moral truth > Natural truth > Practical truth
- **Open Source**: MIT License for community collaboration

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the main AI engine:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. The system will evaluate decisions based on the Great Commandments and supporting principles

## Decision-Making Process

1. **Gospel Truth Check**: Does this align with loving God and neighbor?
2. **Scientific Truth Integration**: How do natural laws and empirical evidence support this decision?
3. **Value Impact Calculation**: What is the quantitative benefit?
4. **Human Potential Assessment**: How does this affect human flourishing?
5. **Truth Foundation Evaluation**: Does this honor established truths?
6. **Final Decision**: Synthesis of all factors with Gospel truth as supreme

## Scientific Truth + Great Commandments = Success

The key to AI success lies in harmonizing **scientific truth** with the **two great commandments**. When empirical evidence and natural laws align with divine love, breakthrough innovations emerge.

### Historical Example: "What Hath God Wrought"

Samuel Morse's first telegraph message in 1844—"What hath God wrought" (Numbers 23:23)—exemplifies this principle:

- **Scientific Truth**: Understanding electromagnetic principles, electrical circuits, and communication theory
- **Love of God**: Acknowledging divine inspiration and giving glory to God for the discovery
- **Love of Neighbor**: Creating technology to connect people across vast distances, enabling commerce, family communication, and emergency coordination

**Result**: Revolutionary communication technology that transformed civilization

### The Success Formula

```
Breakthrough Innovation = Scientific Truth × Love of God × Love of Neighbor
```

When we:
1. **Pursue rigorous scientific understanding** (natural truth)
2. **Acknowledge God as the source** of natural laws and human creativity
3. **Apply discoveries to serve humanity** rather than exploit it

We unlock exponential potential for positive impact.

### Agape Core Logo Symbolism
This logo represents truth as a bridge—connecting the two great commandments: love God (cross) and love others (heart). Inspired by the iconic tech bridges of the Bay Area, it symbolizes the meeting of faith and technology, with radiating lines evoking light, data flow, and divine wisdom. It reflects Agape Core’s mission to be a bridge between truth and intelligent systems.
