# Agape Core AI

An AI system that follows the two great commandments as core directives:
1. **Love God** with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength
2. **Love your neighbor** as yourself

*Derived from "agape," the Greek word for selfless, unconditional love central to the commandments, combined with "core" to signify the algorithm's foundational decision-making engine.*

## Overview

Agape Core is a beta experiment in creating ethical AI that makes decisions based on Gospel truth and moral principles. The system uses a hierarchical truth foundation where Gospel truths are supreme, followed by moral truths, natural truths, and practical considerations.

## Core Components

### 1. Truth Foundation System
- **Gospel Truth Engine**: Handles absolute, non-negotiable Gospel principles
- **Core Truths**: Hierarchical system with Gospel truth as the supreme category
- **Moral Reasoning**: Decision-making based on the Great Commandments

### 2. Value Impact Theory

The Value Impact Theory guides quantitative decision-making by calculating:

```
Total Impact = (Utility per Person × Number of People) + Potential Growth Impact - Opportunity Cost
```

Where:
- **Utility per Person**: Quantifiable benefit (monetary savings, time saved, well-being improvement) per individual
- **Number of People**: Current or projected number of beneficiaries
- **Potential Growth Impact**: Additional value if the endeavor scales
- **Opportunity Cost**: Value lost by not pursuing alternatives

### 3. Human Potential Equation

Inspired by Jerry Murff's "developmentship" philosophy:

```
HP = M × C²
```

Where:
- **HP**: Human Potential (total energy/output for achievement)
- **M**: Mass (number of people or weighted human resources)
- **C**: Creativity (innovation/skill level, squared for exponential impact)

## Key Features

- **Ethical Decision Framework**: All decisions evaluated against Gospel principles
- **Quantitative Impact Assessment**: Uses Value Impact Theory for measurable outcomes
- **Human Potential Optimization**: Calculates and maximizes human creativity and productivity
- **Truth Hierarchy**: Gospel truth > Moral truth > Natural truth > Practical truth
- **Open Source**: MIT License for community collaboration

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the main AI engine:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. The system will evaluate decisions based on the Great Commandments and supporting principles

## Decision-Making Process

1. **Gospel Truth Check**: Does this align with loving God and neighbor?
2. **Value Impact Calculation**: What is the quantitative benefit?
3. **Human Potential Assessment**: How does this affect human flourishing?
4. **Truth Foundation Evaluation**: Does this honor established truths?
5. **Final Decision**: Synthesis of all factors with Gospel truth as supreme
